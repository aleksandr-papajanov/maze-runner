- **Review Process**: Peer review before integration

#### Quality Criteria:
- **Completeness**: All sections of Appendix 1 addressed
- **Consistency**: Requirements traceable through design
- **Clarity**: Understandable to both technical and non-technical stakeholders
- **Testability**: All functional requirements have testable acceptance criteria

### 4.1.5 Risk Management

#### Technical Risks:
- **Risk**: Insufficient detail from system expert interview
- **Mitigation**: Prepare comprehensive question list, follow up via email if needed
- **Impact**: Medium - may require assumptions and validation

- **Risk**: UML diagram complexity beyond team experience  
- **Mitigation**: Start with simple diagrams, use online resources and examples
- **Impact**: Low - can be addressed through learning and iteration

#### Project Management Risks:
- **Risk**: Time constraint (8-hour limit)
- **Mitigation**: Focus on core requirements, use placeholders for less critical details
- **Impact**: Medium - may affect completeness of optional sections

- **Risk**: Team coordination difficulties
- **Mitigation**: Clear role definition, regular check-ins, shared documentation repository
- **Impact**: Low - manageable with good communication

### 4.1.6 Project Scope and Quality Balance

#### Scope Management:
- **Core Focus**: Requirements specification and system design (not implementation)
- **Priority 1**: Use cases, functional requirements, basic UML diagrams
- **Priority 2**: Detailed interface design, comprehensive test plans  
- **Priority 3**: Advanced diagrams, detailed cost analysis

#### Quality vs. Time Trade-offs:
- **Favor**: Clear, testable requirements over exhaustive detail
- **Favor**: Correct UML notation over complex diagrams
- **Favor**: Stakeholder communication over perfect documentation format

## 4.2 Resource and Activity Plan

### 4.2.2 Flexibility and Adaptation

#### Successful Adaptation Strategies:
- **Parallel Work**: Multiple team members working on independent sections simultaneously
- **Iterative Review**: Regular check-ins allowing for course corrections
- **Modular Documentation**: Sections can be updated independently as new information becomes available
- **Placeholder Strategy**: Using structured placeholders allows progress while awaiting clarifications

#### Areas for Improvement:
- **Earlier Expert Engagement**: Could benefit from preliminary questions sent before formal interview
- **Tool Standardization**: Agreeing on UML tools and formats earlier in the project
- **Template Refinement**: More detailed documentation templates could improve efficiency
- **Time Buffer**: Building in extra time for unexpected complexities or rework

#### Resource Flexibility:
- **Role Fluidity**: Team members can support each other's primary areas when needed
- **Priority Adjustment**: Can shift focus based on interview outcomes and stakeholder feedback
- **Quality Scaling**: Can adjust detail level based on time availability while maintaining core requirements
- **Communication Backup**: Multiple documentation and communication channels ensure continuity
