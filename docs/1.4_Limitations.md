# 1.4 Limitations

The scope of this project is limited to **requirements specification and design documentation**.  
The following aspects are explicitly excluded:
- Full implementation of the game logic or networking.
- Graphical design and detailed game art.
- Audio design or sound effects.
- Server deployment and hosting.
- Marketing or distribution of the final product.

All diagrams, specifications, and use cases are limited to describing a **prototype-level system**, intended for future implementation. The main focus remains on clarity, structure, and correctness of the software engineering documentation.
