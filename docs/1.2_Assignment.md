# 1.2 Assignment

The main task is to prepare a complete **project portfolio** for the MazeRunner game.  
The project focuses on software specification, requirements analysis, and system design — not on full implementation.

The MazeRunner game concept:
- Two players compete to solve a maze as quickly as possible.
- Players can influence each other’s progress by collecting special items or triggering obstacles.
- The game is played in real-time between two connected clients.
- Several pairs of players can play simultaneously.
- The game can be displayed on a large screen for the audience.

The result of this laboratory work will be a detailed documentation package that defines:
- functional and non-functional requirements,
- user characteristics and use cases,
- UML diagrams for system design,
- testing and evaluation plans,
- project management and resource planning.
