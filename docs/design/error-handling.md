# 3.6 Error Handling and Edge Cases

## Connection Issues
- **Player Disconnect**: Immediate game termination, return both players to lobby
- **Server Disconnect**: React client displays connection lost message, automatic reconnection attempt
- **Lag Compensation**: Client-side prediction with server reconciliation
- **Timeout Handling**: 30-second inactivity timeout, automatic game forfeit

## Game Logic Edge Cases  
- **Simultaneous Key Collection**: C# server timestamp determines winner
- **Ability Conflicts**: Server processes in received order, later actions may fail
- **Maze Boundary Issues**: Server validates all movements, rejects invalid positions
- **Exit Without Key**: Server prevents exit activation, displays appropriate message

## System Resource Management
- **Memory Cleanup**: Automatic session cleanup after game completion
- **Connection Limits**: Maximum 10 concurrent players, additional connections queued
- **CPU Load Balancing**: Game logic optimized for single-threaded execution
- **Graceful Degradation**: Reduced update frequency under high load conditions

## SignalR-Specific Error Handling
- **Connection Retry Logic**: Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- **Message Acknowledgment**: Critical game events require client confirmation
- **Heartbeat Monitoring**: Regular ping/pong to detect stale connections
- **Graceful Fallback**: Degrade to polling if WebSocket fails
