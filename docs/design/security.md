# 3.7 Security and Validation

## Input Validation
- **Movement Bounds**: All player positions validated against maze geometry on C# server
- **Action Rate Limiting**: Prevent spam clicking of abilities and movements
- **State Integrity**: Server validates all state changes before broadcasting via SignalR
- **Client Trust Model**: Assume React clients may be compromised, validate everything server-side

## Basic Security Measures
- **No Authentication Required**: Matches use case of anonymous gameplay
- **Session Isolation**: Players cannot affect other game sessions
- **Resource Protection**: Prevent clients from overwhelming C# server resources
- **Simple Anti-Cheat**: Movement speed and ability cooldown validation

## ASP.NET Core Security Features
- **CORS Configuration**: Restrict cross-origin requests appropriately
- **Input Sanitization**: Validate all incoming data from React clients
- **SignalR Security**: Use connection-based authorization for game sessions
- **Resource Limits**: Configure appropriate timeout and message size limits

This system design provides a robust foundation for implementing the MazeRunner game with React + C# while maintaining simplicity and reliability as primary design goals.
