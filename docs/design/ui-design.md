# 3.4 User Interface Design

## Player Interface (Mobile/Desktop)

### Core React Components
- **GameViewport**: Limited maze view centered on player
- **ControlPanel**: Movement controls (on-screen joystick or WASD)  
- **AbilityBar**: 3 slots for different items/actions
- **StatusDisplay**: Timer, score, inventory indicators
- **ConnectionStatus**: Network status and game messages

### Responsive Design Requirements
- Minimum screen size: 4 inches (320x568px)  
- Maximum screen size: 27 inches (2560x1440px)
- Consistent gameplay viewport ratio across all devices
- Touch-friendly button sizes (minimum 44px touch targets)

## Spectator Interface (Large Screen)

### Display Elements
- Full maze overview with both players visible
- Player status information (names, scores, items)
- Game timer and session information  
- Winner announcement and celebration effects
- Session selector for multiple concurrent games

## Visual Design Principles
- **High Contrast**: Clear distinction between players, walls, items, and background
- **Minimal Text**: Rely on icons and visual cues rather than written instructions
- **Consistent Theme**: Fantasy/dungeon aesthetic with matching characters and environment  
- **Accessibility**: Different shapes and patterns, not just colors, for key elements
