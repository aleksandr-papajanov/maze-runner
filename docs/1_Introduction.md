# 1.1 Background

MazeRunner is a software engineering project created as part of a course in Software Engineering.  
The purpose of the project is to design and specify a small multiplayer web-based game that can be demonstrated during open-house events at the university. These events aim to attract high school students and provide insight into what computer science and engineering students create.

In 2022, a demonstration game was built using the Ultraleap Stratos Inspire device, which provided hand-tracking and haptic feedback. However, the setup was unreliable and required expensive hardware that was not easily available.  
This project seeks to replace that setup with a simpler and more robust solution that runs on regular laptops or mobile devices through a web browser.

The project is developed using **.NET (C#)** as the primary technology stack. The documentation and specifications are written in English, and the team consists of three members collaborating on design, planning, and analysis.

# 1.2 Assignment

The main task is to prepare a complete **project portfolio** for the MazeRunner game.  
The project focuses on software specification, requirements analysis, and system design — not on full implementation.

The MazeRunner game concept:
- Two players compete to solve a maze as quickly as possible.
- Players can influence each other’s progress by collecting special items or triggering obstacles.
- The game is played in real-time between two connected clients.
- Several pairs of players can play simultaneously.
- The game can be displayed on a large screen for the audience.

The result of this laboratory work will be a detailed documentation package that defines:
- functional and non-functional requirements,
- user characteristics and use cases,
- UML diagrams for system design,
- testing and evaluation plans,
- project management and resource planning.

# 1.3 Problem Description

The previous open-house game demonstration relied on specific hardware (Ultraleap Stratos Inspire) that proved unstable and expensive.  
Because of that, the department now needs a new interactive demo that can:
- run reliably on any laptop or web browser,
- engage and attract visitors,
- demonstrate technical and creative skills of the students.

The main challenge is to **design** a competitive two-player maze game that:
1. Is easy to set up and play within a few minutes.
2. Works in real time between two players.
3. Can visually demonstrate competition and progress on a large screen.
4. Has a clear game flow and technical structure that can be implemented later.

The task of this project is **not** to code the full game, but to clearly define *what should be developed*, *how it should work*, and *how it should be tested and maintained*.

# 1.4 Limitations

The scope of this project is limited to **requirements specification and design documentation**.  
The following aspects are explicitly excluded:
- Full implementation of the game logic or networking.
- Graphical design and detailed game art.
- Audio design or sound effects.
- Server deployment and hosting.
- Marketing or distribution of the final product.

All diagrams, specifications, and use cases are limited to describing a **prototype-level system**, intended for future implementation. The main focus remains on clarity, structure, and correctness of the software engineering documentation.
