# 1.3 Problem Description

The previous open-house game demonstration relied on specific hardware (Ultraleap Stratos Inspire) that proved unstable and expensive.  
Because of that, the department now needs a new interactive demo that can:
- run reliably on any laptop or web browser,
- engage and attract visitors,
- demonstrate technical and creative skills of the students.

The main challenge is to **design** a competitive two-player maze game that:
1. Is easy to set up and play within a few minutes.
2. Works in real time between two players.
3. Can visually demonstrate competition and progress on a large screen.
4. Has a clear game flow and technical structure that can be implemented later.

The task of this project is **not** to code the full game, but to clearly define *what should be developed*, *how it should work*, and *how it should be tested and maintained*.
