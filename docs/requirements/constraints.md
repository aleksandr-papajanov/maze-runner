# 2.5 System Constraints

## Technical Constraints
- **Single server limitation**: All game logic runs on one laptop, no distributed architecture
- **Web technology only**: React frontend with C# backend, no native mobile apps or game engines
- **Network dependency**: Requires stable wifi connection for real-time gameplay
- **Browser compatibility**: Must work without modern JavaScript features on older devices

## Business Constraints  
- **Demonstration context**: Optimized for short-term engagement, not long-term retention
- **Zero installation**: Cannot require app downloads or account creation
- **Noise environment**: Visual feedback prioritized over audio
- **Setup simplicity**: Must be operable by non-technical university staff

## Key Assumptions
- **Target audience familiarity**: Users understand basic maze game concepts
- **Device availability**: Players have smartphones or can use provided devices  
- **Network infrastructure**: University provides adequate wifi for concurrent connections
- **Social context**: Competitive gameplay with audience creates natural engagement
