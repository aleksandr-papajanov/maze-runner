# 1.1 Background and Context

MazeRunner is a web-based multiplayer maze game designed for university open house demonstrations at Lule√• University of Technology (LTU). The project addresses the need for a reliable, engaging demonstration tool that showcases student programming work while serving as an "ice-breaker" to get high school students interested in computer science.

The current hardware-based demonstration system (haptic technology) has proven unreliable due to complex setup requirements, driver compatibility issues, and frequent technical failures. A simple web-based solution is needed that can be set up in under 2 minutes and works consistently across different devices and environments.
