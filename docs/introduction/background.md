# 1.1 Background and Context

MazeRunner is a web-based multiplayer maze game designed for university open house demonstrations at Lule√• University of Technology (LTU). The project addresses the need for a reliable, engaging demonstration tool that showcases student programming work while serving as an "ice-breaker" to get high school students interested in computer science.

## Motivation for Development

The current hardware-based demonstration system (haptic technology) has proven unreliable due to complex setup requirements, driver compatibility issues, and frequent technical failures. Key problems with the previous system include:

- **Complex hardware setup**: Required specialized hardware and driver installations
- **Reliability issues**: Frequently broke with operating system updates  
- **Setup time**: Took significant time to configure and troubleshoot
- **Maintenance burden**: Required constant technical support and updates

## Solution Philosophy

MazeRunner embodies an "always works" philosophy, prioritizing reliability and simplicity over technical complexity. A simple web-based solution is needed that can be set up in under 2 minutes and works consistently across different devices and environments.

## Long-term Vision

Josef Hallberg has been developing interactive demonstration games for LTU open house events for 4 consecutive years. Previous projects encountered synchronization problems and Unity export complexity. MazeRunner is designed for multi-year usage with minimal maintenance, transforming the typical "Are you interested in computer science?" approach into "Want to play a game?"
