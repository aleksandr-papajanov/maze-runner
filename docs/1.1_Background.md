# 1.1 Background

MazeRunner is a software engineering project created as part of a course in Software Engineering.  
The purpose of the project is to design and specify a small multiplayer web-based game that can be demonstrated during open-house events at the university. These events aim to attract high school students and provide insight into what computer science and engineering students create.

In 2022, a demonstration game was built using the Ultraleap Stratos Inspire device, which provided hand-tracking and haptic feedback. However, the setup was unreliable and required expensive hardware that was not easily available.  
This project seeks to replace that setup with a simpler and more robust solution that runs on regular laptops or mobile devices through a web browser.

The project is developed using **.NET (C#)** as the primary technology stack. The documentation and specifications are written in English, and the team consists of three members collaborating on design, planning, and analysis.
