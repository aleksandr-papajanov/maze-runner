# 4.3 Risk Management

## High-Priority Risks

### Risk 1: Expert Interview Unavailability  
- **Impact**: Critical - blocks all detailed requirements gathering
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Contact Josef immediately, prepare backup questions from previous project information
- **Contingency**: Use existing game information and make documented assumptions

### Risk 2: React + C# Integration Complexity
- **Impact**: High - could lead to incomplete system design
- **Probability**: Medium  
- **Mitigation**: Focus on proven SignalR patterns, document assumptions for complex areas
- **Contingency**: Simplify to basic WebSocket implementation

### Risk 3: Time Management Issues
- **Impact**: High - risk of incomplete deliverables
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Strict timeboxing, regular progress check-ins every 2 hours
- **Contingency**: Prioritize must-have sections, clearly mark optional enhancements

## Medium-Priority Risks

### Risk 4: Team Coordination Challenges  
- **Impact**: Medium - could affect quality and consistency
- **Mitigation**: Clear role definitions, shared documentation platform, regular communication
- **Contingency**: Designate quality analyst as integration coordinator

### Risk 5: Documentation Tool Issues
- **Impact**: Low-Medium - could slow progress
- **Mitigation**: Use familiar, reliable tools (Markdown, shared drives)
- **Contingency**: Simple text-based documentation with post-processing

## Risk Monitoring
- **Progress Reviews**: Every 2 hours with go/no-go decisions
- **Quality Gates**: Document review after each major phase
- **Communication Protocol**: Immediate escalation of blocking issues
- **Backup Plans**: Clearly defined scope reduction strategies
