# 4.4 Quality Assurance Framework

## Documentation Standards
- **Consistency**: Uniform formatting, terminology, and style across all documents
- **Completeness**: All required sections from Appendix 1 addressed  
- **Traceability**: Clear connections from requirements through design to React + C# implementation planning
- **Professional Quality**: University-standard documentation suitable for academic submission

## Review Process

### Peer Review Strategy
- Each major document section reviewed by team member who didn't write it
- Technical accuracy verified by system designer
- Requirements completeness verified by project lead
- Overall quality and integration verified by quality analyst

### Quality Checkpoints
1. **Requirements Review** (Hour 3.5): Completeness and stakeholder alignment
2. **Design Review** (Hour 6): Technical feasibility and requirements traceability  
3. **Integration Review** (Hour 7.5): Document consistency and professional presentation
4. **Final Review** (Hour 8): Submission readiness and completeness verification

## Success Criteria
- **All Appendix 1 requirements addressed**: Introduction, Requirements, Design, Execution
- **Minimum 5 UML diagrams completed**: Class, Sequence, Activity, State, Module/Architecture
- **Expert interview insights integrated**: All stakeholder requirements documented
- **Technology focus maintained**: React + C# considerations throughout documentation
- **Professional presentation standard**: Suitable for academic and professional review

## Quality Metrics
- **Document completeness**: 100% of required sections present
- **Technical accuracy**: All React/C# references validated
- **Consistency score**: Terminology and formatting uniform across documents
- **Review coverage**: Every section reviewed by at least one other team member
