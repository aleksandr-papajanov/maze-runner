# MazeRunner Game - Complete Vision

## Game Overview

MazeRunner is a simple, web-based multiplayer maze game designed as an interactive demonstration tool for university open house events. The game creates an engaging "ice-breaker" experience that gets high school students excited about computer science while showcasing student work.

## Core Gameplay Experience

### The Basic Game Loop
1. **Quick Setup**: Students scan a QR code or visit a URL on their phones/laptops
2. **Instant Matching**: First player waits, second player joins â†’ game starts automatically  
3. **5-Minute Adventure**: Players race through a maze to find a key and escape
4. **Spectator Excitement**: Audience watches on a large screen, cheering and giving hints
5. **Simple Conclusion**: Winner celebration, optional high score entry, back to start

### What Players See and Do

**On Your Device (Phone/Laptop)**:
- Top-down view of your character in the maze
- You only see a small portion around your character (like a spotlight in darkness)
- Character faces the direction you're moving (important for aiming abilities)
- Simple controls: Arrow keys/WASD on computer, on-screen joystick on phone
- 3 ability buttons on the right side of screen

**On the Big Screen (Spectator View)**:
- Full maze overview showing both players
- Everyone can see the entire layout, key location, exit location
- Perfect for audience to cheer: "The key is behind you!" or "Watch out, they're coming!"

## Character and World

### Visual Style
- **Top-down perspective** (like classic arcade games)
- **Fantasy theme preferred**: Wizards or warriors moving through a dungeon-style maze
- **Simple but clear graphics**: Easy to distinguish your character from opponent
- **Consistent theme**: If characters are wizards, the maze looks like a dungeon (not modern building)

### Your Character
- Either a detailed animated sprite with legs/movement OR a simple geometric shape with direction arrow
- Different visual appearance from opponent (different color AND different shape - important for accessibility)
- Clear indication of which direction you're facing (affects where you shoot abilities)

## Core Gameplay Mechanics

### The Objective
**Win condition**: Find the key, then reach the exit first
- **Key**: Hidden somewhere in the maze, location randomized each game
- **Exit**: Visible to everyone, but you need the key to use it
- **Strategy element**: You can camp at the exit and ambush the key-holder!

### Movement and Vision
- **Fog of War**: You only see a circular area around your character
- **Maybe**: 5-second full-map preview at the start, then fog kicks in
- **Fair Play**: All devices show roughly the same amount of the maze (same "viewport")

### Combat System - The Fun Part!
Players can use abilities to stop each other:

**Ability Types**:
1. **Stun Shot**: Freeze opponent for 2 seconds, they drop the key
2. **Confusion Ray**: Reverse opponent's controls (left becomes right, etc.)
3. **Speed Boost**: Move faster for a short time (auto-activates when picked up)

**Ability Usage**:
- 3 ability slots, each with different cooldown/usage rules
- Some activate automatically when you walk over them (speed boost)
- Others you save and use strategically (stun shot, confusion ray)
- Visual feedback: See projectiles fly, see impact effects, know if you hit/missed

**Strategic Elements**:
- Hide near the exit and ambush the key-holder
- Set traps at chokepoints
- Hunt down the person with the key using compass direction (given after some time)

## Items and Power-ups

### Collectible Items
- **Bonus Points**: Apple/coin-like objects scattered around maze for high score
- **Power-ups**: Speed boost, better vision, extra abilities
- **Secret Letters**: Optional side-quest to spell a daily word for prizes

### Risk vs Reward
- Collecting bonus items makes you vulnerable (takes time, exposes position)
- Key-holder is visible to others through compass hints after time passes
- Smart players balance speed, combat, and collection

## Technical Experience

### Device Compatibility
**Works on Everything**:
- Modern smartphones (Android/iOS, even 6-7 years old)
- Laptops and desktops (Windows/Mac/Linux)
- Tablets and other touch devices

**Controls Adapt to Device**:
- **Phone**: On-screen joystick (left thumb) + ability buttons (right side)
- **Computer**: WASD movement + keyboard shortcuts for abilities
- **Flexible**: Can use mouse, trackpad, or keyboard-only depending on setup

### Performance Requirements
- **Fast startup**: From QR code scan to playing in under 1 minute
- **Smooth gameplay**: <100ms response time for movements
- **Reliable**: Works even with spotty wifi, handles disconnections gracefully
- **Scalable**: Supports 5 concurrent games (10 players) without issues

## Social and Spectator Experience

### The "E-sports" Element
- **Big screen drama**: Audience sees everything, players don't
- **Natural commentary**: "He's right behind you!" "The key is over there!"
- **Tension building**: Close races to the exit, last-second ability usage
- **Quick turnaround**: Games end fast enough to keep audience engaged

### Educational Value
- **Student showcase**: "This game was made by students in their 3rd year"
- **Tech demonstration**: Shows web development, real-time networking, game design
- **Conversation starter**: Gets students talking about programming and game development
- **Accessibility**: No need to explain complex rules - everyone understands "find key, reach exit"

## Game Flow and Timing

### Typical Game Session (3-5 minutes)
1. **0-30 seconds**: Players join, brief instruction screen, countdown
2. **30 seconds - 3 minutes**: Core gameplay - exploring, finding key, combat
3. **3-5 minutes**: Endgame - key holder racing to exit, final confrontations
4. **Optional**: Overtime assistance (compass to key) if game runs long

### End Conditions
- **Victory**: First player to exit with key wins
- **Connection loss**: Game ends, both players return to start screen
- **Time limit**: Soft limit with assistance, not hard cutoff
- **Results**: Clear winner/loser screen, points display, optional high score entry

## Why This Design Works

### For the University (Josef's Goals)
- **Reliable**: No hardware setup, no driver issues, just open browser
- **Portable**: Runs on one laptop, works anywhere with wifi
- **Maintainable**: Web technology, easy updates, familiar to students
- **Scalable**: Multiple games running simultaneously without problems

### For High School Students
- **Instantly familiar**: Maze games are universally understood
- **Social experience**: Fun to play with friends, fun to watch others
- **Quick gratification**: Fast games, immediate feedback, clear winners
- **Low barrier**: No app download, no account creation, just scan and play

### For the Audience
- **Visual excitement**: Can see the whole game unfold on big screen
- **Participation**: Natural urge to help and cheer for players
- **Understanding**: Easy to follow what's happening, clear objectives
- **Replayability**: Each game is different due to randomized elements
